        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the
          three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two
          around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other
          animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in
          chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release
          all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch
          around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of
          rolling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the
          fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He's energetic, mischievous, and
          easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for
          moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn't get
          a snack.

        <p>
          Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. She loves sneaking
          into the bedroom and hopping onto the neatest bed. She also loves riding in a car with the
          windows open feeling the wind and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride
          to a big arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup of
          tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the dining table, which
          was surprising because she is normally gentle and polite. She took the stolen corn to the
          patio and enjoyed her meal by herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so
          she ended up vomiting it all later.
